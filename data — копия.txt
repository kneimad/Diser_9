Amikita: subList is a very powerful and useful mechanism. The documentation prescribes the idiom to remove a range of elements by theList.subList(from, to).clear(), for example. PeriodicalLiveViewList is just a variation where the view is not a contiguous block but periodical/cyclical (i.e. every N-th element). As I mentioned previously, I've actually have had many usecases for such a view. You are right that for this particular problem, it's may be an overengineered solution, but if provided, this is a very valuable tool for many list manipulation scenarios.
